# Ceasar_Cipher_Decryption
This Java program implements the decryption process for the Caesar Cipher, allowing users to reverse the encryption by shifting each letter of the cipher text back by a three positions in the alphabet.

# Overview
The program allows users to decrypt a given encrypted text by reversing the encryption process using the Caesar Cipher technique. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while maintaining the original case of the characters in the output. Non-alphabetic characters (symbols, numbers, spaces, etc.) remain unchanged in the decrypted text.

# How to Use
Running the Program
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java development environment or compile the Caesar_Cipher_Decryption.java file.
Run the program.
Enter the encrypted text you want to decrypt when prompted.
The program decrypts the input text using the Caesar Cipher technique with a fixed shift of 3 (or the specified shift value) and displays the decrypted result.

# Example
Suppose you have the encrypted text Khoor, Zruog!. Running the program and providing this text as input will output Decrypted: Hello, World! as the decrypted text.

# Usage Notes
The program uses the Scanner class to take user input for the encrypted text that needs to be decrypted.
The default shift value used for decryption is 3 for the Caesar Cipher. Modify the shift variable in the code to change the decryption strength.
Ensure to use the same shift value that was used during the encryption process to get the accurate decrypted result.
